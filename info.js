// What is the use of JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development.
//  It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages, handle events, 
// manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and communicate with servers through AJAX.
//  JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming with environments like Node.js,
//  enabling full-stack development. Additionally, it supports functional and
//  object-oriented programming paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of 
// applications beyond just web development.
